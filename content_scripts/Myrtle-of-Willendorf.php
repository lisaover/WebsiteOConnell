        <p>Walter Hogan gets it! He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sBonMSm-W3YC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=">writes</a> about <span class="italic">Myrtle</span> in his thorough and perceptive <span class="italic"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0810850729">Humor in Young Adult Literature: A Time to Laugh</a></span>. (see pages 99&ndash;100)</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Often witty and even more often provocative, this first novel is arresting. It testifies to O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s talents that she leaves readers wanting more, not less, of her oversize heroine.&rdquo;<br>
          <span class="quote">&mdash;Publishers Weekly</span></p>
        <p>&ldquo;This powerful first novel is well written and thought&ndash;provoking. Teens will appreciate Myrtle&rsquo;s self&ndash;deprecating humor and cheer for her as she begins to realize her true strengths and like herself as she is.&rdquo; <br><span class="quote">&mdash;School Library Journal</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;A small, perfect gem.&rdquo; <br><span class="quote">&mdash;<a href="http://www.readingrants.org/2007/05/03/myrtle-of-willendorf-by-rebecca-oconnell/">Reading Rants</a></span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Like adolescence itself, the novel is by turns funny and poignant, and the potent theme of the female deity, made suitably incarnate by the character of Myrtle, puts a fresh twist on the journey of self-discovery.&rdquo; <br><span class="quote">&mdash;Horn Book</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;The author did a wonderful job in making Myrtle thoroughly believable.&rdquo;<br>
